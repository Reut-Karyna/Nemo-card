  <em>Clownfish is a small marine fish which gained worldwide
    popularity after appearing in the animated movie "Finding Nemo".
    There are 28 different species of clownfish that inhabit Indian and
    Pacific oceans, Red Sea and Australian Great Barrier Reef. Clownfish
    lives in the warm water, near the coral reefs. Biggest threats to the
    survival of clownfish are pollution of the ocean, overfishing and
    destruction of their habitat. Luckily, population of clownfish in
    the wild is still large and stable. These animals are not on the
     list of endangered species. </em>
